The script listens for commands related to our inside joke about the Chinese Communist Party Social Credit System and responds accordingly. The Signal API GitHub repo was instrumental in setting this up.\nBackground # To make our group chat more engaging, we came up with a joke CCP social credit system where we assign points based on various actions. I decided to automate this process using a Python script that listens for commands and updates points accordingly.\nSetting Up the Environment # First, I set up the necessary environment to interact with the Signal API. This involved configuring the API endpoints and ensuring proper communication with the Signal server. I was able to accomplish this by using an unofficial signal-cli-rest-api.\nbbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api Dockerized Signal Messenger REST API Go 1184 144 Sending and Receiving Messages # The script includes functions to send and receive messages via the Signal API. The send_message function is responsible for sending messages to the group, and the receive_messages function listens for new messages.\nParsing and Processing Commands # The script parses commands related to the CCP social credit system and processes them accordingly. Commands include adding users, listing all users, updating points, and more. This ensures the script can respond appropriately to various interactions in the chat. The script only accepts commands from selected users to make sure it cant be tampered with.\nParsing Commands # The parse_command function identifies commands from the chat messages. Here are some examples of the commands it can parse:\nAdding a User: /CCP adduser \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;\nif text.startswith(\u0026#34;/CCP adduser\u0026#34;): parts = text.split() if len(parts) == 3: command, action, user = parts if action == \u0026#34;adduser\u0026#34;: return {\u0026#34;action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;adduser\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: user} Listing All Users: /CCP listall\nelif text.startswith(\u0026#34;/CCP listall\u0026#34;): return {\u0026#34;action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;listall\u0026#34;} Updating Points: /CCP \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; \u0026lt;points\u0026gt;\nelif text.startswith(\u0026#34;/CCP\u0026#34;): parts = text.split() if len(parts) == 3: command, user, points_str = parts try: points = int(points_str) return {\u0026#34;action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;update_points\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: user, \u0026#34;points\u0026#34;: points} except ValueError: return {\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Invalid points value\u0026#34;} Processing Commands # The process_command function executes actions based on parsed commands. Here are some examples of the actions it can perform:\nAdding a User:\nif action == \u0026#34;adduser\u0026#34;: user = command_data.get(\u0026#34;user\u0026#34;) result = add_user_to_database(user) return f\u0026#34;User {user} has been added.\u0026#34; if result else f\u0026#34;Failed to add user {user}. It may already exist.\u0026#34; Listing All Users:\nelif action == \u0026#34;listall\u0026#34;: return list_users_and_scores() Updating Points:\nelif action == \u0026#34;update_points\u0026#34;: user = command_data.get(\u0026#34;user\u0026#34;) points = command_data.get(\u0026#34;points\u0026#34;) if points is not None: success, total_points = update_user_points(user, points) return f\u0026#34;{points} points updated for user {user}. Total points: {total_points}.\u0026#34; if success else f\u0026#34;Failed to update points for user {user}.\u0026#34; else: return \u0026#34;Error: Invalid points value.\u0026#34; These functions ensure that the script can correctly interpret and act upon the various commands issued in the group chat, making the \u0026ldquo;CCP\u0026rdquo; social credit system interactive and fun for everyone involved.\nDatabase Management # I used SQLite to manage user data and their points. This involved creating and maintaining tables for users and their corresponding points, ensuring data persistence and easy retrieval.\nAdding and Updating Users # The script handles adding new users and updating their points in the database. The add_user_to_database function inserts a new user, and the update_user_points function adjusts the points for an existing user.\nListing Users and Scores # The script retrieves and displays the list of users and their corresponding scores. The list_users_and_scores function queries the database and formats the results into a readable format.\nRunning the Script # The script runs in a continuous loop on my Proxmox Server, checking for new messages and processing commands. It listens for messages, parses commands, and executes the necessary actions, providing real-time interaction within the group chat.\nConclusion # Creating this Python script to automate interactions in our Signal group chat has added a fun twist to our conversations. The joke CCP social credit system now runs smoothly, making our chats more engaging and entertaining. Feel free to use and customize the script for your own group chat automations.

The aim was to repurpose an older server into a versatile virtualization platform for various projects, including remote access, monitoring, and container management.\nBackground # I recently purchased an HP ProLiant DL380p server off Facebook Marketplace. The server\u0026rsquo;s specifications include:\n2 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2640 0 @ 2.50GHz 64 GB DDR3 RAM HP Ethernet 1Gb 4-port 331FLR Adapter 2.2 TB RAID 1 Storage It was previously running Windows Server 2012 and was used for running VMs with Hyper-V. I decided to switch to Proxmox to leverage its Linux base and robust virtualization capabilities.\nInitial Setup Challenges # Firmware Update # My first challenge was to boot the server via USB with the Proxmox installer, but the server\u0026rsquo;s firmware was outdated. HP provided an old USB ISO for firmware updates, but it was so outdated that it didn\u0026rsquo;t work. I then turned to the Integrated Lights-Out (ILO) interface for firmware updates.\nLearning ILO # Navigating the ILO interface was a struggle initially. I had to do extensive research to understand its functionalities. Eventually, I managed to update the firmware through the ILO interface, bringing the server up to date. Surprisingly, HP still supports firmware updates for this older server model.\nInstalling Proxmox # With the server firmware updated, I used the ILO\u0026rsquo;s virtual DVD feature to mount the Proxmox installer ISO. I successfully installed Proxmox and formatted the disks to my preferences.\nConfiguring Proxmox and VMs # Initial VM Setup # The first thing I did was provision and install a basic Red Hat Linux VM. On this VM, I installed a Cloudflare tunnel, allowing me to securely access my private network from Penn State without the need for port forwarding.\nMonitoring and Security # I installed Uptime Kuma, an open-source monitoring service, on the server. Uptime Kuma provides a simple dashboard to monitor various services, including my website, server, tunnel, and SSH access.\nlouislam/uptime-kuma A fancy self-hosted monitoring tool JavaScript 52433 4721 Additionally, I enhanced security by installing fail2ban on the VMs with SSH access and configuring Proxmox permissions to restrict unauthorized access.\nfail2ban/fail2ban Daemon to ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors Python 11104 1200 Container Management # To manage Docker containers efficiently, I installed Portainer. This tool allows me to easily spin up and manage containers, such as my Signal API bot.\nFuture Plans # With the Proxmox server set up to my liking, I am ready to spin up numerous VMs for practicing red teaming and blue teaming cybersecurity skills. The first test will be during an upcoming Red vs Blue team exercise. I am also looking to learn Anisble for VM deployments and installing Wazuh SIEM to help monitor for threats.\nConclusion # Setting up this server has been a rewarding project, turning an older piece of hardware into a powerful and flexible virtualization platform. The combination of Proxmox, Cloudflare tunnel, Uptime Kuma, and Portainer has provided me with a robust environment for learning and experimentation.\nFeel free to follow along with these steps and customize your setup to suit your needs.
