The aim was to repurpose an older server into a versatile virtualization platform for various projects, including remote access, monitoring, and container management.\nBackground # I recently purchased an HP ProLiant DL380p server off Facebook Marketplace. The server\u0026rsquo;s specifications include:\n2 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2640 0 @ 2.50GHz 64 GB DDR3 RAM HP Ethernet 1Gb 4-port 331FLR Adapter 2.2 TB RAID 1 Storage It was previously running Windows Server 2012 and was used for running VMs with Hyper-V. I decided to switch to Proxmox to leverage its Linux base and robust virtualization capabilities.\nInitial Setup Challenges # Firmware Update # My first challenge was to boot the server via USB with the Proxmox installer, but the server\u0026rsquo;s firmware was outdated. HP provided an old USB ISO for firmware updates, but it was so outdated that it didn\u0026rsquo;t work. I then turned to the Integrated Lights-Out (ILO) interface for firmware updates.\nLearning ILO # Navigating the ILO interface was a struggle initially. I had to do extensive research to understand its functionalities. Eventually, I managed to update the firmware through the ILO interface, bringing the server up to date. Surprisingly, HP still supports firmware updates for this older server model.\nInstalling Proxmox # With the server firmware updated, I used the ILO\u0026rsquo;s virtual DVD feature to mount the Proxmox installer ISO. I successfully installed Proxmox and formatted the disks to my preferences.\nConfiguring Proxmox and VMs # Initial VM Setup # The first thing I did was provision and install a basic Red Hat Linux VM. On this VM, I installed a Cloudflare tunnel, allowing me to securely access my private network from Penn State without the need for port forwarding.\nMonitoring and Security # I installed Uptime Kuma, an open-source monitoring service, on the server. Uptime Kuma provides a simple dashboard to monitor various services, including my website, server, tunnel, and SSH access.\nlouislam/uptime-kuma A fancy self-hosted monitoring tool JavaScript 52433 4721 Additionally, I enhanced security by installing fail2ban on the VMs with SSH access and configuring Proxmox permissions to restrict unauthorized access.\nfail2ban/fail2ban Daemon to ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors Python 11104 1200 Container Management # To manage Docker containers efficiently, I installed Portainer. This tool allows me to easily spin up and manage containers, such as my Signal API bot.\nFuture Plans # With the Proxmox server set up to my liking, I am ready to spin up numerous VMs for practicing red teaming and blue teaming cybersecurity skills. The first test will be during an upcoming Red vs Blue team exercise. I am also looking to learn Anisble for VM deployments and installing Wazuh SIEM to help monitor for threats.\nConclusion # Setting up this server has been a rewarding project, turning an older piece of hardware into a powerful and flexible virtualization platform. The combination of Proxmox, Cloudflare tunnel, Uptime Kuma, and Portainer has provided me with a robust environment for learning and experimentation.\nFeel free to follow along with these steps and customize your setup to suit your needs.
