## Understanding MACCDC

### Competition Structure

MACCDC is a prestigious cybersecurity competition that challenges teams to defend a simulated corporate network against a team of professional hackers (the Red Team). The competition consists of several phases, starting with the qualifiers, followed by regional competitions, and culminating in the wildcard round and national championships.

### Our Journey

We started by advancing past the qualifiers, which was a significant achievement in itself. Moving on, we excelled in the regional competition, securing 2nd place out of 10 teams a first for PSU! This success propelled us to the wildcard competition, where we competed fiercely but ultimately ended our journey.

## Reflection and Future Plans

The experience at MACCDC has been both challenging and rewarding. It has provided us with invaluable hands-on experience in defending against real-world cyber threats. Although our journey ended at the wildcard round, we are motivated by our achievements and the skills we've gained.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to hone our cybersecurity skills and prepare for future competitions!
